These are functions for producing 32-bit hashes for hash table lookup.
hashword(), hashlittle(), hashlittle2(), hashbig(), mix(), and final() 
are externally useful functions.  Routines to test the hash are included 
if SELF_TEST is defined.  You can use this free for any purpose.  It's in
the public domain.  It has no warranty.
